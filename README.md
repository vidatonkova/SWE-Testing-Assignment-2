The Unit Tests of this assignment are in the UT.py file and get run from the main of the UT.py file. 
The Stubs and Mocks are created in the Dubs.py file but are run through the main of the main.py file. 
The database is called accounting.db and is a file that is uploaded into this Github repository. It doesn't have any of the host and version information because it is a file created by the program onto my computer.
